  Abstract                 = {Spatial planning decisions are frequently driven by short term economic interests influencing zoning regulations which determine subsequent spatial developments in the future. Not only does this frequently place constraints on prospective space for planning measures; it also leads to progressive soil loss. In order to integrate soil-related issues in decision-making processes, a broad range of specific soil services should be considered. Thus, approaches have been developed to convert available soil data to decision-relevant soil information. Soil function evaluation is used as a tool for differentiating soils due to their role in a functional context. This paper outlines development and concepts of this approach on the basis of available soil data records in Germany and Austria. It also demonstrates how an adapted hemeroby ranking can be integrated into soil evaluation. Furthermore, we present some evaluation examples from Austria, showing evaluation results and how to communicate them for better integration into spatial planning decisions. In general, this soil evaluation approach provides evidence that the results are suitable to be introduced into spatial planning procedures, which is crucial for sustainable land use in the future.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract
This essay summarizes deliberation by the Soil Science Society of America (SSSA) Ad Hoc Committee on Soil Quality (S-581) and was written to spur discussion among SSSA members. Varying perceptions of soil quality have emerged since the concept was suggested in the early 1990s, and dialogue among members is important because, unlike air and water quality, legislative standards for soil quality have not been and perhaps should not be defined. In simplest terms, soil quality is "the capacity (of soil) to function". This definition, based on function, reflects the living and dynamic nature of soil. Soil quality can be conceptualized as a three-legged stool, the function and balance of which requires an integration of three major components — sustained biological productivity, environmental quality, and plant and animal health. The concept attempts to balance multiple soil uses (e.g., for agricultural production, remediation of wastes, urban development, forest, range, or recreation) with goals for environmental quality. Assessing soil quality will require collaboration among all disciplines of science to examine and interpret their results in the context of land management strategies, interactions, and trade-offs. Society is demanding solutions from science. Simply measuring and reporting the response of an individual soil parameter to a given perturbation or management practice is no longer sufficient. The soil resource must be recognized as a dynamic living system that emerges through a unique balance and interaction of its biological, chemical, and physical components. We encourage SSSA members to consider the concept of soil quality (perhaps as a marketing tool) and to debate how it might enable us to more effectively meet the diverse natural resource needs and concerns of our rural, urban, and suburban clientele of today and tomorrow.},
