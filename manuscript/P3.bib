  Abstract                 = {Landform delineation has long been used in digital soil mapping to infer soil-relevant information. While its potential as an environmental variable in soil parameter modeling has been investigated for various automated landform delineations, little research has been invested into the relationship between the delineation of landforms by algorithms based on digital terrain models (DTM) and the perception of landforms by the soil surveyor during field work. Five Open Source automated landform classification algorithms and a support vector machine classifier based on single terrain parameters are investigated with regard to their ability to replicate topographic position, at two different scales, as described by surveyors for soil profile sites in the Alpine environment of South Tyrol. We also analyse how the variation of parameters and cell size affects the distribution of the computed landforms. While a clear trend regarding grid cell size and window size can be observed with regard to the difference between macro and meso scale topographic positions, the overall classification accuracy regarding the different topographic position classes was less promising. Although some automated classifications partly resemble the surveyor's classification, a considerable number of issues remain to be investigated in order to explain the lack of reproducibility of surveyor position, some of which are linked to the Alpine environment of the study area. These include the dominance of the backslope position, the objectivity of the surveyor in rugged terrain under forest cover, and the fuzzy nature of classifying topographic position, especially in steep terrain. By applying a forward stepwise feature selection procedure for a model based on single terrain parameters, we show that at macro scale a regional terrain parameter (topographic wetness index) and curvatures at a coarse DTM resolution of 50m are the most influential in distinguishing topographic position, whereas at meso scale it is the topographic position index (TPI) with a search radius of just 70m combined with slope gradient. This study is an important first step towards consolidating topographic perception during field survey and digital terrain analysis, which, at least in Alpine terrain, still requires more investigation.},

  Abstract                 = {Spatial planning decisions are frequently driven by short term economic interests influencing zoning regulations which determine subsequent spatial developments in the future. Not only does this frequently place constraints on prospective space for planning measures; it also leads to progressive soil loss. In order to integrate soil-related issues in decision-making processes, a broad range of specific soil services should be considered. Thus, approaches have been developed to convert available soil data to decision-relevant soil information. Soil function evaluation is used as a tool for differentiating soils due to their role in a functional context. This paper outlines development and concepts of this approach on the basis of available soil data records in Germany and Austria. It also demonstrates how an adapted hemeroby ranking can be integrated into soil evaluation. Furthermore, we present some evaluation examples from Austria, showing evaluation results and how to communicate them for better integration into spatial planning decisions. In general, this soil evaluation approach provides evidence that the results are suitable to be introduced into spatial planning procedures, which is crucial for sustainable land use in the future.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a novel method for classification and mapping of landform elements from a {DEM} based on the principle of pattern recognition rather than differential geometry. At the core of the method is the concept of geomorphon (geomorphologic phonotypes) — a simple ternary pattern that serves as an archetype of a particular terrain morphology. A finite number of 498 geomorphons constitute a comprehensive and exhaustive set of all possible morphological terrain types including standard elements of landscape, as well as unfamiliar forms rarely found in natural terrestrial surfaces. A single scan of a {DEM} assigns an appropriate geomorphon to every cell in the raster using a procedure that self-adapts to identify the most suitable spatial scale at each location. As a result, the method classifies landform elements at a range of different spatial scales with unprecedented computational efficiency. A general purpose geomorphometric map — an interpreted map of topography — is obtained by generalizing allgeomorphons to a small number of the most common landform elements. Due to the robustness and high computational efficiency of the method high resolution geomorphometric maps having continental and even global extents can be generated from giga-cell DEMs. Such maps are a valuable new resource for both manual and automated geomorphometric analyses. In order to demonstrate a practical application of this new method, a 30&#xa0;m cell−&#xa0;1 geomorphometric map of the entire country of Poland is generated and the features and potential usage of this map are briefly discussed. The computer implementation of the method is outlined. The code is available in the public domain.},

  Review                   = {IMPLEMENTED IN GRASS 7 Allgemein: most existing methods of automated landform classification have their roots in differential geometry. The differences between different existing approaches focus on how to best utilize the information contained in geomorphometric variables, and on the choice of target units of classification. Methods can be divided into those which are cell-based and those which are oject based. They can be also divided into those which use a classifier designed manually on the basis of expert knowledge and empirical evidence and those which use a classifier generated by a machine learning algorithm Finally, methods can be divided with respect to target units of classification (Minar and Evans, 2008); considered units include: landforms, landform elements, and physio graphic units (für zitate siehe paper). NOVEL APPORACH THAT DEPARTS FROM EXISTING METHODOLOGIES: we classify landform elements using tools of computer vision rather than tools of differential geometry. Thus, our algorithm attempts to mimic the classification process carried out by a human analyst. Image texture refers to the spatial arrangement of grayscale intensities in a selected region of an image. we utilize the concept of Local Ternary Patterns (LTP) (Liao, 2010) to identify local landform elements. The set of all possible LTPs is finite (498). Geomorphons are fundamental micro-structures of landscape. Instead of using a fixed-size neighborhood to collect elevation values for determination of LTP, we use a neighborhood with size and shape that self-adapts to the local topography. This self-adaptation technique utilizes the line-of-sight principle (Lee, 1991; Nagy, 1994; Yokoyama et al., 2002) and ensures that landforms are identified at their most appropriate spatial scale. We demonstrate how to generate a map of the 10 most common landform elements (peak, ridge, shoulder, spur, slope, hollow, footslope, valley, pit, and flat) using geomorphons. local ternary patterns: looks at 8 neighbours, gives them the values lower,same,equal. In practive however the quantity derived from line-of-sight-principle is used instead of simply the elevation values. By using different L-values (lookup-distance) landform elements can be identified on a wider range of scales than with the grid-based neighbourhood. CLASSIFICATION INTO 10 LANDFORMS: While traversing a LTP in order of principal directions a “transition” is a change in ternary element. Thus geomorphons flat, peak, and pit have 0 transitions, as all ternary elements in their patterns are the same. Shoulder, spur, hollow, and valley have 2 transitions, while ridge, valley, and slope have 4 transitions. We have chosen a reclassification formula based on a particular lookup table constructed on the basis of similarity between ternary patterns representing the geomorphons; patterns are similar if they have similar number of different ternary elements. GOOD DESCRIPTION OF HOW THEY COMPARED THEIR APPROACH TO THOSE OF WOOD and DIKAU with GRASS: other methods are incomplete.., it is possible to merge (Schmidt and Hewitt, 2004) Wood's and Dikau's classification schemes into a single scheme showing all 15 landform types, but needs fuzzy classification (computational cost!) SCALE FLEXIBILITY: The geomorphons method does not use a fixed-size neighborhood, instead the size and the shape of a neighborhood from which the land- form element is determined adjusts automatically to the geometry of the local terrain. The value of L determines the maximum scale at which we can find the landform element; it needs to be set to a relatively large value in order for the map to show landform elements at a broad range of scales. The inner, irregular octagons are determined by the LOS-principle in the 8 principle directions. Increasing L values converge to same result. CONCLUSION: Geomorphons represent a paradigm shift in DEM classification. First, the method is underpinned by principles of machine vision rather than differential geometry. Second, it classifies landforms at different spatial scales simultaneously.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This essay summarizes deliberation by the Soil Science Society of America (SSSA) Ad Hoc Committee on Soil Quality (S-581) and was written to spur discussion among SSSA members. Varying perceptions of soil quality have emerged since the concept was suggested in the early 1990s, and dialogue among members is important because, unlike air and water quality, legislative standards for soil quality have not been and perhaps should not be defined. In simplest terms, soil quality is "the capacity (of soil) to function". This definition, based on function, reflects the living and dynamic nature of soil. Soil quality can be conceptualized as a three-legged stool, the function and balance of which requires an integration of three major components — sustained biological productivity, environmental quality, and plant and animal health. The concept attempts to balance multiple soil uses (e.g., for agricultural production, remediation of wastes, urban development, forest, range, or recreation) with goals for environmental quality. Assessing soil quality will require collaboration among all disciplines of science to examine and interpret their results in the context of land management strategies, interactions, and trade-offs. Society is demanding solutions from science. Simply measuring and reporting the response of an individual soil parameter to a given perturbation or management practice is no longer sufficient. The soil resource must be recognized as a dynamic living system that emerges through a unique balance and interaction of its biological, chemical, and physical components. We encourage SSSA members to consider the concept of soil quality (perhaps as a marketing tool) and to debate how it might enable us to more effectively meet the diverse natural resource needs and concerns of our rural, urban, and suburban clientele of today and tomorrow.},

  Abstract                 = {Publisher Summary This chapter presents different formulations, each one of them with a different degree of mathematical complexity, to extract basic morphometric parameters from the digital elevation model (DEM) itself and then discuss importance and interpretation of each parameter. The study of morphometric land-surface parameters start with those related to the local morphometry of each point. They are divided into two main groups: (1) Geometric and (2) statistical measures. For each type of land-surface parameter, a detailed description has been given including further information on the physical phenomena described by each one. The chapter introduces some well-known parameters, such as slope or aspect, and then extends that to some less common ones, such as the Shape Complexity Index, the Anisotropic Coefficient of Variation, geostatistical land-surface parameters, or fractal-based ones that represent the most actual trend in this field.},

  Review                   = {basic parameters: derived directly from DEM, represent the raw shape of the land surface regardless of relationship to formational processes. LOCAL: geometric parameters: methods based on formal mathematical approach have proven give better results. #functions of first derivative# slope: description of evans method. area of a cell: also different methods (eg considering the surrounding cell heights) aspect: is a circular land-surface parameter, therefore some others use cos(a) as slope northness and sin(a) as slope easterness, especially in statistical comparisons. shaded relief: the simplest approach neglects surrounding relief and considers insolation as a local parameter hydrology is an important field applying geomorphometry, which hast resulted in specific formulations for calculating slope and aspect,starting with D8(using the maximum-slope, which usually overestimates slope, and aspect values can only be a multiple of 45°, restricting their range and discretizing the slope measurement).D-infinity also consider the two adjacent directions to account for discretization. #functions of second derivatives#: an important concept for understanding curvature is the 'normal section of a smoothed surface'.A normal section is a plane curve, the curvature of which is defined as 1/R, where R is the radius of the best-fitting circle. An effective way to introduce simple curvatures onto a slope is to consider some chosen (4) directions on it. cells with concave plan curvature(of contour line) have converging flow lines. in the same way, material flow experiences relative develeration in cells which have a concave profile curvature. Mean curvature(profc+tangc)/2, describes mean-concave and mean-convex terrains.Positive values are associated iwth areas of relative accumulation. Shary:12 curvatures, of which 3 are used to derive the rest: mean, unsphericity (how does surface differ from sphere) and difference curvature(is vertical or horizontal c stronger?). PROFC has a significant relation with soil moisture, indicating whether a cell is prone to accumulating water or not. CURVATURES ARE HOWEVER A FIRST APPROXIMATION AT A LOCAL LEVEL. visibility and line of sight, viewshed: if angle between two points A and B is smaller than that of a point closer to A, then B is not visible. viewshed is not a continuous polygon! This leads to calculation of solar irradiation. visibility index: nr of cells that can be seen from a cell. LOCAL (neighborhood): statistical parameters_ the first four moments in the distribution of a value: average, standard deviation, skewness coefficient, and the kurtosis coefficient. other examples: ruggedness=range/sqrt(area), terrain roughness=how undulating the terrain is (different concepts), for instance the stddev of heights in analysis window. to avoid incorrect results, one solution is to fit a plane to cells in the window and then calculate the stddev of the fitting instead. for densely measured elevations (LiDAR), the surface roughness index can be derived as the ratio between the fitted nugget variation and the local variance..... Anisotropy index= by variogram modelling in various directions. the Anistropy Coefficient of Variation (ACV) is the difference of the first derivative in 4 directsions, and can be used to distinguish elongated from oval landforms. Fractal dimension is an indicator of terrain complexity and closely related to terrain roughness. DISCRETE ANALYSIS: a new trend is the application of existing indices and parameters originally introduced for other types of data. Since landscape metrics mostly deal with descrete data, sliceing the DEM into elevation classes serves as discretization. Then the shape and structure of each class can be analysed to derive new indices. EXAMPLE: Shape Complexity Index SCI indicateds how compact (or oval) a feature is. REGIONAL LAND-SURFACE PARAMETERS: watershed: using flow-algorithms, go upwards and add cells connected with the outlet cell. For a given watershed, LandSurfaceParameter = sum(Ai), i=index for each cell. ; Instead of adding the mean might also be calculated. AND, to derive new meaningfull parameters, we can connect this equation with of the local land-surface parameters like slope (relates to speed and power of flow) or height (constituting the potential energy).A hypsometric curve gives information about the internal configuration of the catchment. the elevation-relief ratio can also be calacuated. (z_avg-z_min)/(z_max-z_min). Parameters based on linear measure can also be calculated for a watershed, such as flow-path lengths, or slope length (.e.g in USLE), with different methods. Teh definition of interruption cells at which the calculations stop can be done usting a fixed-slope thrshold, or a ration between slope of a cell and the one sitatued upslope, or the average or maximum uphill slope angel. With this information more parameters,like the horizontal or vertical distances to the closest channel cell can be used, for instance to relate to the wetness of the cell.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Empirical models are frequently applied to produce landslide susceptibility maps for large areas. Subsequent quantitative validation results are routinely used as the primary criteria to infer the validity and applicability of the final maps or to select one of several models. This study hypothesizes that such direct deductions can be misleading. The main objective was to explore discrepancies between the predictive performance of a landslide susceptibility model and the geomorphic plausibility of subsequent landslide susceptibility maps while a particular emphasis was placed on the influence of incomplete landslide inventories on modelling and validation results. The study was conducted within the Flysch Zone of Lower Austria (1,354 km2) which is known to be highly susceptible to landslides of the slide-type movement. Sixteen susceptibility models were generated by applying two statistical classifiers (logistic regression and generalized additive model) and two machine learning techniques (random forest and support vector machine) separately for two landslide inventories of differing completeness and two predictor sets. The results were validated quantitatively by estimating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) with single holdout and spatial cross-validation technique. The heuristic evaluation of the geomorphic plausibility of the final results was supported by findings of an exploratory data analysis, an estimation of odds ratios and an evaluation of the spatial structure of the final maps. The results showed that maps generated by different inventories, classifiers and predictors appeared differently while holdout validation revealed similar high predictive performances. Spatial cross-validation proved useful to expose spatially varying inconsistencies of the modelling results while additionally providing evidence for slightly overfitted machine learning-based models. However, the highest predictive performances were obtained for maps that explicitly expressed geomorphically implausible relationships indicating that the predictive performance of a model might be misleading in the case a predictor systematically relates to a spatially consistent bias of the inventory. Furthermore, we observed that random forest-based maps displayed spatial artifacts. The most plausible susceptibility map of the study area showed smooth prediction surfaces while the underlying model revealed a high predictive capability and was generated with an accurate landslide inventory and predictors that did not directly describe a bias. However, none of the presented models was found to be completely unbiased. This study showed that high predictive performances cannot be equated with a high plausibility and applicability of subsequent landslide susceptibility maps. We suggest that greater emphasis should be placed on identifying confounding factors and biases in landslide inventories. A joint discussion between modelers and decision makers of the spatial pattern of the final susceptibility maps in the field might increase their acceptance and applicability. },
