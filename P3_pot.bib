  Abstract                 = {Soils and their functions are critical to ensure the provision of various ecosystem services (ES). Many authors nevertheless argue that there are a lack of satisfactory operational methods for quantifying the contributions of soils to the supply of ES. In this study, we review ES mapping studies that have taken the roles of soils in ES supply into account, and propose soil function assessment (SFA) methods approved by German Federal States in spatial planning procedures to use in assessments of ES supply. We found 181 ES mapping studies in which the roles of soils in ES supply were considered. At least one soil property was used as an indicator of soil-related ES in 60% of the publications, and 13% of the publications were mainly focused on the roles of soils in supplying ES. More than two soil functions were considered in a minority of cases, indicating that the multi-functionality of soils has barely been taken into account in previous ES studies. Several decades ago, the soil science community has adopted the concept of soil functions to bring different aspects of soil to the fore and to emphasize the multi-functionalities of soils and their vastly different chemical, physical, and biological properties. We provide a set of approved SFA methods that cover the multi-functionalities of soils and are applicable to ES supply assessments. We propose that this set of operational SFA methods is a starting point for quantifying how soil systems underpin the supply of a wide range of ES. The minimal soil dataset required for these SFA methods is relatively small, and much progress has been made nationally and globally over the last decade in improving soil data infrastructure and online access for end users. These improvements will facilitate the incorporation of SFA into ES studies and thereby improve information for land use decisions. We recommend that ES assessments include the essential and multifunctional roles of soils to promote sustainable land use.},

  Abstract                 = {Spatial planning decisions are frequently driven by short term economic interests influencing zoning regulations which determine subsequent spatial developments in the future. Not only does this frequently place constraints on prospective space for planning measures; it also leads to progressive soil loss. In order to integrate soil-related issues in decision-making processes, a broad range of specific soil services should be considered. Thus, approaches have been developed to convert available soil data to decision-relevant soil information. Soil function evaluation is used as a tool for differentiating soils due to their role in a functional context. This paper outlines development and concepts of this approach on the basis of available soil data records in Germany and Austria. It also demonstrates how an adapted hemeroby ranking can be integrated into soil evaluation. Furthermore, we present some evaluation examples from Austria, showing evaluation results and how to communicate them for better integration into spatial planning decisions. In general, this soil evaluation approach provides evidence that the results are suitable to be introduced into spatial planning procedures, which is crucial for sustainable land use in the future.},

  Abstract                 = {Soils are a fundamental factor in the transition towards a sustainable bioeconomy. In this context, society depends on fertile soils and their long-term maintenance because of their various ecosystem services. So far, little is known about how soils should be governed to ensure their long-term vitality and sustainable use within a bioeconomy. This article reviews the existing literature on soil governance and outlines topics for future research. The current knowledge about the relation of state and non-state actors and different levels within soil governance are presented. Different instrument types and deficits of existing instruments in soil governance are discussed. Soil governance is an underdeveloped research field and deserves more attention in environmental and natural resource governance.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This essay summarizes deliberation by the Soil Science Society of America (SSSA) Ad Hoc Committee on Soil Quality (S-581) and was written to spur discussion among SSSA members. Varying perceptions of soil quality have emerged since the concept was suggested in the early 1990s, and dialogue among members is important because, unlike air and water quality, legislative standards for soil quality have not been and perhaps should not be defined. In simplest terms, soil quality is "the capacity (of soil) to function". This definition, based on function, reflects the living and dynamic nature of soil. Soil quality can be conceptualized as a three-legged stool, the function and balance of which requires an integration of three major components — sustained biological productivity, environmental quality, and plant and animal health. The concept attempts to balance multiple soil uses (e.g., for agricultural production, remediation of wastes, urban development, forest, range, or recreation) with goals for environmental quality. Assessing soil quality will require collaboration among all disciplines of science to examine and interpret their results in the context of land management strategies, interactions, and trade-offs. Society is demanding solutions from science. Simply measuring and reporting the response of an individual soil parameter to a given perturbation or management practice is no longer sufficient. The soil resource must be recognized as a dynamic living system that emerges through a unique balance and interaction of its biological, chemical, and physical components. We encourage SSSA members to consider the concept of soil quality (perhaps as a marketing tool) and to debate how it might enable us to more effectively meet the diverse natural resource needs and concerns of our rural, urban, and suburban clientele of today and tomorrow.},

  Abstract                 = {Soils provide essential ecosystem services for supporting both human and ecosystem needs and has been under pressures resulting from the intensification and expansion of human activities. In the last 15 years, substantial efforts have been made to quantify the impacts on soils derived from production systems and their related supply chains. In this study, a systematic, qualitative evaluation of up-to-date models connecting land occupation and land transformation to soil impact indicators (e.g., soil properties, functions, and threats) is performed. The focus is on models that may be applied for assessing supply chains, namely in the context of life cycle assessment (LCA). A range of eleven soil-related models was selected and evaluated against different criteria, including scientific soundness, stakeholders' acceptance, reproducibility, and the applicability of models from the perspective of LCA practitioners. Additionally, this study proposes a new land use cause-effect chain to qualify the impacts of land use on soils. None of the models is fulfilling all the criteria and includes comprehensively the cause-effect impact pathways. Notably, trade-offs were most frequent between the relevance of the modeled impact processes and the models' applicability. On the one hand, models proposing multi-indicators cover several drivers of impacts and have a broader scope. On the other hand, several models just focus on one driver of impact, but may provide more relevant impact characterization. Our results provide common ground for the development and identification of models that provide a comprehensive and robust assessment of land use change and land use impacts on soils. Indeed, to ensure both a comprehensive and relevant characterization of impacts, the study identifies several research needs for further models' developments, namely: 1) adopting a common land use cause-effect chain and land use classification; 2) accounting for different land management and land use intensities; 3) expanding the inventory data beyond the accounting of the area related to a certain land use; 4) assessing the added value of multi-indicators compared to single indicators, including the reduction of possible redundancies in the impact evaluation; 5) improving consistency from midpoint to endpoint characterization, especially the link with biodiversity; 6) guiding the calculation of normalization factors; and 7) assessing systematically model's uncertainty.},
